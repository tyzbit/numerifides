# Prior art

Some similar work has already been done in this space, such as the first altcoin
ever, Namecoin.  Namecoin is a great system that does suffer from some technical
shortcomings such as the prevalence of "namesquatting".  Also, its mining algorithm
was a good choice at the time as the second crypto, but is a security liability
as one of hundreds of cryptos today.

Blockstack also has the Blockchain Name System<sup>1</sup> where TLDs can be registered and
pricing schemes can be devised for any name being registered in the namespace.
This is distinct from Numerifides because TLDs can be "namesquat" or federated.
Names on Numerifides are registered in the namespace of each data type.

Other projects in the space are Distributed ID, OneName, and others.
