## Extensions

Extensions can be written to interface the client into any legacy lookup standard
such as creating a virtual Certificate Authority for the system that vouches for
certificates looked up via Numerifides, or for DNS lookups.  Eventually software
could be written to natively interface with Numerifides (such as OS-level
integration for DNS lookups and verifying software)
